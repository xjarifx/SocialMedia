### Conclusion

**Finding: NO ISSUES DETECTED**

All systems are operational. The application is running correctly with:

- Both servers running
- No compilation errors
- No runtime errors
- All recent changes applied successfully
- All previous bugs fixed

### Possible Reasons for User Concern

1. **Port Change**: Client switched from port 5173 to 5174

   - This is normal when port 5173 is already in use
   - Solution: Access app at http://localhost:5174/

2. **Terminal Exit Codes**: Previous terminal sessions showed Exit Code: 1

   - This was from OLD terminal sessions
   - New terminals are running successfully
   - No current errors

3. **Browser Cache**: Old version might be cached
   - Solution: Hard refresh (Ctrl+Shift+R) or clear cache

### Recommendations

1. **Access the app at**: http://localhost:5174/
2. **Clear browser cache** if seeing old UI
3. **Hard refresh** the page (Ctrl+Shift+R)
4. **Check browser console** for any runtime warnings (not compilation errors)

### Files Verified as Healthy

- ✅ CommentModal.tsx
- ✅ PostCard.tsx
- ✅ PostFeed.tsx
- ✅ Button.tsx
- ✅ api.ts
- ✅ comment-controller.ts
