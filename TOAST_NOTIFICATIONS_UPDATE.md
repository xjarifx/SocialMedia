# Toast Notifications Update

## Summary

Replaced native browser `alert()` and `confirm()` dialogs with a modern, styled toast notification system and confirmation dialog component.

## Changes Made

### 1. New Components Created

#### `ConfirmDialog.tsx`

- Location: `client/src/components/ui/ConfirmDialog.tsx`
- A reusable confirmation dialog component with:
  - Smooth animations using Framer Motion
  - Dark theme styling matching the app design
  - Support for different variants (primary/danger)
  - Loading state support
  - Customizable title, message, and button text

### 2. Updated Components

#### `PostCard.tsx`

**Before:**

- Used `window.confirm()` for delete confirmation
- Used `window.alert()` for error messages

**After:**

- Uses `ConfirmDialog` component for delete confirmation
- Uses `useToast()` hook for success/error messages
- Added new state: `showDeleteConfirm`
- Split delete handler into:
  - `handleDeleteClick()` - Opens confirmation dialog
  - `handleDeleteConfirm()` - Executes deletion after confirmation
- Shows toast notifications:
  - Success: "Post deleted successfully"
  - Error: "Failed to delete post. Please try again."

#### `EditPostModal.tsx`

**Before:**

- Used `window.alert()` for error messages

**After:**

  - Success: "Post updated successfully"
  - Error: "Failed to update post. Please try again."

## User Experience Improvements

   - Delete button (red)
3. After confirmation:
   - Shows loading state on the button
   - On success: Toast notification appears with success message
   - On error: Toast notification appears with error message
